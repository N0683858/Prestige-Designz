        <h2>What is Flex Box?</h2>
        <p>Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout method for laying out items in rows or columns. Flexbox allows us to
            distribute space dynamically across elements of an unknown size, hence the term 'flex'. It gives us
            control over how much space each element should take up on the screen.</p>
        <p>You can watch a Youtube video on how
            it works <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phWxA89Dy94&ab_channel=SlayingTheDragon">here.</a></p>

        <h3>Example 1</h3>
        <img src="Img/flex_example.png" alt="">
        <img src="Img/flex_example_code.png" alt="">
        <p>Here you can see 5 div's inside a container that are overflowing as we have set the height and width to 200px
            which results in them being too big for all of them to fit inside the container.</p>
        <h3>Example 2</h3>
        <img src="Img/flex_example2.png" alt="">
        <img src="Img/flex_example2_code.png" alt="">
        <p>However, if we give the container used in the first example, the 'flex' property it changes how the elements
            inside it behave. As you can now see, all the divs are inside a container in a row. Giving the container the
            'flex' property just means we are going to use flex related properties inside this container.</p>

        <hr />
        <h2 id="1">Flex Direction</h2>
        <p>In flex box, by default the elements are set on the Y-axis (horizontal), however we can change the direction
            we want the elements to be displayed.</p>
        <img src="Img/the_flex_model.png" alt="">
        <h3 id="2">Row</h3>
        <p>The <span>'flex-direction'</span> property allows us to decide which axis direction we want our elements to
            be displayed. The default flex direction is <span>'row'</span>. Another of the property we can use to change
            the direction is called <span>'row-reverse'</span> which as the name implies, reverses the row of elements.
        </p>
        <img src="Img/flex_direction_row-reverse.png" alt="">
        <img src="Img/flex_direction_row-reverse_example.png" alt="">
        <hr>
        <h3 id="3">Column</h3>
        <p>Another way to display elements inside a flexbox is by displaying them the X-axis (vertically). We can do
            this by giving the flex-direction property a value of <span>'column'</span> and
            <span>'column-reverse'</span> if we want the columns to be displayed in reverse.</p>
        <img src="Img/flex_direction_column.png" alt="">
        <img src="Img/flex_direction_column_example.png" alt="">
        <p>As you can see, the divs elements aren't 200x200 anymore, that's because we set a hight on the container of
            500px, so the flexbox makes the div elements smaller to fit inside the container. If we make the container
            bigger, then the div elements will also grow (maximum they will grow to 200x200).</p>
        <hr>
        <h2 id="4">Justify Content</h2>
        <h3>Flex Start/End</h3>
        <img src="Img/flex_end.png" alt="">
        <img src="Img/flex_start.png" alt="">
        <p>Flex start will push the content to the right, the start of the container, and "flex-end" will push the
            content to the end of the container.</p>
        <hr>
        <h3 id="5">Center</h3>
        <img src="Img/flex_center.png" alt="">
        <p>This will center all the content between both axis.</p>
        <hr>
        <h3 id="6">Space Between/Around</h3>
        <img src="Img/flex_space_between.png" alt="">
        <p><span>Space between</span> takes all the empty space, and distributes in in between the elements, but not on
            the outside
            edges. <span>Space around</span> distributes the empty space equally "around" each element, but it looks a
            little weird.
        </p>
        <img src="Img/flex_space_around.png" alt="">
        <hr>
        <h3 id="7">Space Evenly</h3>
        <img src="Img/flex_space_evenly.png" alt="">
        <img src="Img/flex_space_evenly_code.png" alt="">
        <p>Space evenly ensures all the empty space is distributed evenly between all the elements in the container.</p>
        <hr>

        <h2 id="8">Flex Wrap</h2>
        <img src="Img/flex_wrap.png" alt="">
        <p>When you have too much content inside the container, flexbox will shrink it to make it all fit. However, this
            will change thw size of the content i.e divs which is not how you intended it to look.</p>
        <img src="Img/flex_wrap_example.png" alt="">
        <p> So flexbox has a property called <span>flex-wrap</span> which will push the remaining content onto the next
            row/column while respecting the original width and size you assigned the content. Or you can use
            <span>wrap-reverse</span> so the content is wrapped in reverse on the <span>opposite axis.</span>.</p>
        <img src="Img/flex_wrap_example1.png" alt="">

        <hr>

        <h2 id="9">Align Items</h2>
        <p>Align items is something we use to distribute our items/content, similar to justify content, however on the
            Y-axis, whereas justify content distributes space on the main (X-axis).</p>
        <p>It also has similar properties such as <span>flex-start, center, flex-end.</span></p>
        <img src="Img/flex_baseline.png" alt="">
        <p>One extra value it takes is called <span>baseline</span> which aligns the content using the baseline of our
            text.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2 id="10">Align Content</h2>
        <p>Align content is used to distribute <span>empty space</span> between the cross axis only when we have
            multiple rows/columns. It only takes effect when you have <span>wrap</span> or (wrap reserver) turned on. As
            you can see in the example below, where are 3 columns and when you assign
            <span>align-content:space-between</span> it distributes the empty space equally in between the content.</p>
        <img src="Img/align_content_spacebetween.png" alt="">
        <p>
            Similarly, if you use the other values such as <span>flex-start</span> it will align the content to the
            start of the container but the 2 rows still remain.
        </p>
        <img src="Img/align_content_flex_start.png" alt="">
        <hr>
        <h3 id="11">Align Self</h3>
        <p>Align self is very similar to align items, except its a property we add to individual items or elements which
            are <span>not</span> in the flex containers. We can change the alignment along the cross axis for a single
            element.</p>
        <img src="Img/align_self.png" alt="">
        <p> As you can see in the example above, all the elements are aligned to the top of the container as
            they have the value of <span>flex-start</span>, however the second element is given the
            <span>align-self</span> property with the value of <span>flex-end</span>.</p>

        <hr>
        <h3 id="12">Flex-Basis, Grow & Shrink</h3>
        <img src="Img/flex_shorthand.png" alt="">
        <p><span>Flex</span> property is a shorthand for flex-basis, flex-grow and flex-shrink. You can pass in few
            different values. </p>

        <h4>Flex-Basis</h4>
        <img src="Img/flex_basis.png" alt="">
        <p>Flex basis basically sets the initial size of the element you want it to be, ignoring the width or
            height, depending on what the main axis is. When there is a flex item, it will automatically have flex
            basis. The default value is set to <span>auto</span>.</p>

        <h4>Flex-Grow</h4>
        <img src="Img/flex_grow.png" alt="">
        <p>Flex grow allows you to decide how much empty space an <span>individual</span> element should take up. You
            may want the first dive to take up twice as more space as the second div. You can do this by using the
            flex-grow property as it allows elements to grow when there is more space available.</p>
        <img src="Img/flex_grow_example.png" alt="">

        <h4>Flex-Shrink</h4>
        <img src="Img/flex_shrink.png" alt="">
        <p>When there is not enough space in the container, flex-shrink determines how much you want an element to
            shrink compared to other elements in the container. If you give an element the value of 0, it will not
            shrink.</p>

        <h3>Media Queries</h3>
        <p>Media Queries allow us to modify our stylesheets (the way the website should look) depending on certain
            parameters such as screen size, device type (mobile, tablet etc) or device orientation (portrait/landscape).
