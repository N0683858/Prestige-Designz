    <section>
        <h2 id="1">Position Property</h2>
        <section id="static">
            <h4>Static</h4>
            <div></div>
            <div class="middle"></div>
            <div></div>
            <p>This is the default value. The element is positioned according to the normal
                flow of the document. The top, right, bottom, left and z-index properties have no effect.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="relative">
            <h4 id="2">Relative</h4>
            <div></div>
            <div class="middle"></div>
            <div></div>
            <p>The element is positioned according to the normal flow of the document, and then offset
                relative to itself based on the values of top, right, bottom, and left. The offset does not affect the
                position of any other elements; thus, the space given for the element in the page layout is the same as
                if position were static. For example, when I set the 'top' and right attribute to 25px, it offset the
                position of the middle div but the space around it will remain the same.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="absolute">
            <h3 id="3">Absolute</h3>
            <div></div>
            <div class="middle"></div>
            <div></div>
            <p>The element is removed from the normal document flow, and no space is created for the element in the page
                layout. It is positioned relative to its closest positioned ancestor, if any; otherwise, it is placed
                relative to the initial containing block. Its final position is determined by the values of top, right,
                bottom, and left. You can see what happens when we set the middle div's position as absolute. You may
                not be able to see the last div because it is under the middle div since the middle div has been removed
                from the flow so its not taking up any space.</p>

            <h5>Example 2</h5>
            <div></div>
            <div id="absolute2"></div>
            <div></div>
            <p>In this example you can see what happens when we set the middle div's 'left' value as 50px. It
                ignores the document flow and positions itself to the far left to it's ancestor, in this case being the
                'body'. However, if you also assign a position to the parent element, then it will no longer position
                itself to the far left but will remove inside the containing block, in this case being the 'section'.
            </p>

            <section id="absoluteExample">
                <h5>Example 3</h5>
                <div></div>
                <div id="absolute3"></div>
                <div></div>
                <p>In this example, you can see what happens when you just give the containing block a 'relative'
                    position. The middle div is still assigned an absolute position with the 'left' value of 50px but
                    this time it behaves
                    differently.</p>
            </section>
        </section>

        <section id="fixed">
            <h3 id="4">Fixed</h3>
            <div></div>
            <div class="middle"></div>
            <div></div>
            <p>If an element is assigned the property of fixed, then it will be fixed in place. The element is removed
                from the normal document flow, and no space is created for the element in the page layout. As you can
                see, the div on the top left stays at the top-left even when we scroll down.</p>

            <p>Another property of position which is similar to fixed is sticky. If an element is assigned the sticky
                position, it will stay in its place, but when you start scrolling, it will remain in that position on
                your screen. This is ver useful when making a NavBar.</p>
